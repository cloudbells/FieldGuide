# FieldGuide
An addon for World of Warcraft: Classic.

`/fg` and `/fieldguide` will open the window.
`/fg minimap` or `/fieldguide minimap` will toggle the minimap button on or off.

*This is a work in progress*.

## Features
- Shows you which spells each class learns every level to plan when you need to go back to town.
- Shows you which classes can learn which weapon skills (staves, one-handed swords and so on).
- Tells you how much each spell/weapon skill costs to train so you know if you can afford it or not.
- Allows you to choose to display talents/known spells or not.

## Planned Features (in no particular order)
- Show ranks for each spell (there is currently no way of doing this with the API).
- Show AQ tomes and spells that are gained through quests (such as the Mage's Conjure Water rank 7).
- When clicking on a weapon skill, the addon will create a TomTom arrow, and mark the trainer on your map and minimap.
- When clicking on any spell, it should also do the same as above – except it will choose the nearest trainer to where you are. (Perhaps an option to show the nearest Honored trainer for the 10% reduction in cost.)
- Show Warlock pet skills (probably just together with the Warlock skills).

## Possible Future Features
- Allow player to mark spells that they do not wish to train, and distinguish these in the addon (as well as possibly at the trainer).
- Allow player to drag any (known) spells onto his/her action bars from the addon.

## Bugs
- Scroll bar texture sometimes is completely black, possibly due to the black texture loading late.
